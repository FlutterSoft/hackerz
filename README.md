## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This is a website made with just HTML, CSS and JS. The CSS uses some colour variables on the root, it includes media queries and is responsive. There is also a modal that is activated using JavaScript


## Optimizations

Using a forEach to add a click event to the navigation items was something I changed after, makes the code cleaner. I'm still working on laying out CSS in a way that reduces the amount of redundancy. Need to use typography classes I think.


## Lessons Learned:

Learning how to add click events to a number of different DOM elements. The ease of use with Grid and media queries to change layout for smaller devices. How to add a responsive menu and a modal.
